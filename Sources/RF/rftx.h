// and rftx_Send returns _FALSE. There are as many queue slots as there are id's.
// id indicates the id of the receiver (from 0 to 7). The content of the message (of length bits, up to 128) must be stored beforehand in data, and 
// must not be modified until eot is called, since the module will be actively using this portion of RAM.
// eot is called when the tranmission ends, and a new tranmission can be requested at this time.
